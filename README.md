# Zeus Saloon Fight
The purpose of the script is to start a bar fight and have a fair fist fight. To do this you just need to enter any bar, raise your gun in the air and fire it. 
You will then get a warning message and everyone in the bar will be restricted from using their weapons, running, jumping, etc. and will be forced to engage in a fist fight.

## Installation
- Throw it into your `resources` folder
